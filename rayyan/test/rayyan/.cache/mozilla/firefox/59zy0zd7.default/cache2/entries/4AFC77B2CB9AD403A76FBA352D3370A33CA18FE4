       All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree,
       the file hierarchy, rooted at <b>/</b>.  These files can be spread out over
       several devices.  The <b>mount </b>command serves to attach the filesystem
       found on some device to the big file tree.  Conversely, the <a href="../man8/umount.8.html">umount(8)</a>
       command will detach it again.

       The standard form of the <b>mount </b>command is:

              <b>mount -t </b><i>type device dir</i>

       This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on <i>device</i> (which
       is of type <i>type</i>) at the directory <i>dir</i>.  The previous contents (if
       any) and owner and mode of <i>dir</i> become invisible, and as long as this
       filesystem remains mounted, the pathname <i>dir</i> refers to the root of
       the filesystem on <i>device</i>.

       If only the directory or the device is given, for example:

              <b>mount /dir</b>

       then <b>mount </b>looks for a mountpoint (and if not found then for a
       device) in the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file.  It's possible to use the <b>--target </b>or
       <b>--source </b>options to avoid ambivalent interpretation of the given
       argument.  For example:

              <b>mount --target /mountpoint</b>

       <b>The listing.</b>
              The listing mode is maintained for backward compatibility
              only.

              For more robust and customizable output use <a href="../man8/findmnt.8.html">findmnt(8)</a>,
              <b>especially in your scripts</b>.  Note that control characters in
              the mountpoint name are replaced with '?'.

              The following command lists all mounted filesystems (of type
              <i>type</i>):

                     <b>mount </b>[<b>-l</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>type</i>]

              The option <b>-l </b>adds labels to this listing.  See below.

       <b>The device indication.</b>
              Most devices are indicated by a filename (of a block special
              device), like <i>/dev/sda1</i>, but there are other possibilities.
              For example, in the case of an NFS mount, <i>device</i> may look like
              <i>knuth.cwi.nl:/dir</i>.  It is also possible to indicate a block
              special device using its filesystem label or UUID (see the <b>-L</b>
              and <b>-U </b>options below), or its partition label or UUID.
              (Partition identifiers are supported for example for GUID
              Partition Tables (GPT).)

              Don't forget that there is no guarantee that UUIDs and labels
              are really unique, especially if you move, share or copy the
              device.  Use <b>lsblk -o +UUID,PARTUUID </b>to verify that the UUIDs
              are really unique in your system.

              The recommended setup is to use tags (e.g. <b>LABEL=</b><i>label</i>) rather
              than <b>/dev/disk/by-{label,uuid,partuuid,partlabel} </b>udev
              symlinks in the /etc/fstab file.  Tags are more readable,
              robust and portable.  The <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> command internally uses
              udev symlinks, so the use of symlinks in /etc/fstab has no
              advantage over tags.  For more details see <a href="../man3/libblkid.3.html">libblkid(3)</a>.

              Note that <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> uses UUIDs as strings.  The UUIDs from the
              command line or from <a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a> are not converted to internal
              binary representation.  The string representation of the UUID
              should be based on lower case characters.

              The <i>proc</i> filesystem is not associated with a special device,
              and when mounting it, an arbitrary keyword, such as <i>proc</i> can
              be used instead of a device specification.  (The customary
              choice <i>none</i> is less fortunate: the error message `none busy'
              from <b>umount </b>can be confusing.)

       <b>The /etc/fstab, /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts files.</b>
              The file <i>/etc/fstab</i> (see <a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a>), may contain lines
              describing what devices are usually mounted where, using which
              options.  The default location of the <a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a> file can be
              overridden with the <b>--fstab </b><i>path</i> command-line option (see
              below for more details).

              The command

                     <b>mount -a </b>[<b>-t </b><i>type</i>] [<b>-O </b><i>optlist</i>]

              (usually given in a bootscript) causes all filesystems
              mentioned in <i>fstab</i> (of the proper type and/or having or not
              having the proper options) to be mounted as indicated, except
              for those whose line contains the <b>noauto </b>keyword.  Adding the
              <b>-F </b>option will make <b>mount </b>fork, so that the filesystems are
              mounted simultaneously.

              When mounting a filesystem mentioned in <i>fstab</i> or <i>mtab</i>, it
              suffices to specify on the command line only the device, or
              only the mount point.

              The programs <b>mount </b>and <b>umount </b>traditionally maintained a list
              of currently mounted filesystems in the file <i>/etc/mtab</i>.  This
              real mtab file is still supported, but on current Linux
              systems it is better to make it a symlink to <i>/proc/mounts</i>
              instead, because a regular mtab file maintained in userspace
              cannot reliably work with namespaces, containers and other
              advanced Linux features.

              If no arguments are given to <b>mount</b>, the list of mounted
              filesystems is printed.

              If you want to override mount options from <i>/etc/fstab</i> you have
              to use the <b>-o </b>option:

                     <b>mount </b><i>device</i>|<i>dir</i> <b>-o </b><i>options</i>

              and then the mount options from the command line will be
              appended to the list of options from <i>/etc/fstab</i>.  The usual
              behavior is that the last option wins if there are conflicting
              ones.

              The <b>mount </b>program does not read the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file if both
              <i>device</i> (or LABEL, UUID, PARTUUID or PARTLABEL) and <i>dir</i> are
              specified.  For example, to mount device <b>foo </b>at <b>/dir</b>:

                     <b>mount /dev/foo /dir</b>

       <b>The non-superuser mounts.</b>
              Normally, only the superuser can mount filesystems.  However,
              when <i>fstab</i> contains the <b>user </b>option on a line, anybody can
              mount the corresponding filesystem.

              Thus, given a line

                     <b>/dev/cdrom  /cd  iso9660  ro,user,noauto,unhide</b>

              any user can mount the iso9660 filesystem found on an inserted
              CDROM using the command

                     <b>mount /dev/cdrom</b>

              or

                     <b>mount /cd</b>

              For more details, see <a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a>.  Only the user that mounted a
              filesystem can unmount it again.  If any user should be able
              to unmount it, then use <b>users </b>instead of <b>user </b>in the <i>fstab</i>
              line.  The <b>owner </b>option is similar to the <b>user </b>option, with
              the restriction that the user must be the owner of the special
              file.  This may be useful e.g. for <i>/dev/fd</i> if a login script
              makes the console user owner of this device.  The <b>group </b>option
              is similar, with the restriction that the user must be member
              of the group of the special file.

       <b>The bind mounts.</b>
              Since Linux 2.4.0 it is possible to remount part of the file
              hierarchy somewhere else.  The call is:

                     <b>mount --bind </b><i>olddir newdir</i>

              or by using this fstab entry:

                     <b>/</b><i>olddir</i> <b>/</b><i>newdir</i> <b>none bind</b>

              After this call the same contents are accessible in two
              places.  One can also remount a single file (on a single
              file).  It's also possible to use the bind mount to create a
              mountpoint from a regular directory, for example:

                     <b>mount --bind foo foo</b>

              The bind mount call attaches only (part of) a single
              filesystem, not possible submounts.  The entire file hierarchy
              including submounts is attached a second place by using:

                     <b>mount --rbind </b><i>olddir newdir</i>

              Note that the filesystem mount options will remain the same as
              those on the original mount point.

              <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> since v2.27 allow to change the options by passing
              the <b>-o </b>option along with <b>--bind </b>for example:

                     <b>mount --bind,ro foo foo</b>

              This feature is not supported by Linux kernel and it is
              implemented in userspace by additional remount mount(2)
              syscall. This solution is not atomic.

              The alternative (classic) way to create a read-only bind mount
              is to use remount operation, for example:

                     <b>mount --bind </b><i>olddir newdir</i>
                     <b>mount -o remount,ro,bind </b><i>olddir newdir</i>

              Note that read-only bind will create a read-only mountpoint
              (VFS entry), but the original filesystem superblock will still
              be writable, meaning that the <i>olddir</i> will be writable, but the
              <i>newdir</i> will be read-only.

              It's impossible to change mount options recursively (for
              example b  <b>-o rbind,ro</b>).

       <b>The move operation.</b>
              Since Linux 2.5.1 it is possible to atomically move a <b>mounted</b>
              <b>tree </b>to another place.  The call is:

                     <b>mount --move </b><i>olddir newdir</i>

              This will cause the contents which previously appeared under
              <i>olddir</i> to now be accessible under <i>newdir</i>.  The physical
              location of the files is not changed.  Note that <i>olddir</i> has to
              be a mountpoint.

              Note also that moving a mount residing under a shared mount is
              invalid and unsupported.  Use <b>findmnt -o TARGET,PROPAGATION </b>to
              see the current propagation flags.

       <b>The shared subtree operations.</b>
              Since Linux 2.6.15 it is possible to mark a mount and its
              submounts as shared, private, slave or unbindable.  A shared
              mount provides the ability to create mirrors of that mount
              such that mounts and unmounts within any of the mirrors
              propagate to the other mirror.  A slave mount receives
              propagation from its master, but not vice versa.  A private
              mount carries no propagation abilities.  An unbindable mount
              is a private mount which cannot be cloned through a bind
              operation.  The detailed semantics are documented in
              <b>Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt </b>file in the kernel
              source tree.

              Supported operations are:

                     <b>mount --make-shared </b><i>mountpoint</i>
                     <b>mount --make-slave </b><i>mountpoint</i>
                     <b>mount --make-private </b><i>mountpoint</i>
                     <b>mount --make-unbindable </b><i>mountpoint</i>

              The following commands allow one to recursively change the
              type of all the mounts under a given mountpoint.

                     <b>mount --make-rshared </b><i>mountpoint</i>
                     <b>mount --make-rslave </b><i>mountpoint</i>
                     <b>mount --make-rprivate </b><i>mountpoint</i>
                     <b>mount --make-runbindable </b><i>mountpoint</i>

              <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> <b>does not read fstab</b>(5) when a <b>--make-</b>* operation is
              requested.  All necessary information has to be specified on
              the command line.

              Note that the Linux kernel does not allow to change multiple
              propagation flags with a single <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> syscall, and the
              flags cannot be mixed with other mount options.

              Since util-linux 2.23 the <b>mount </b>command allows to use several
              propagation flags together and also together with other mount
              operations.  This feature is EXPERIMENTAL.  The propagation
              flags are applied by additional <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> syscalls when the
              preceding mount operations were successful.  Note that this
              use case is not atomic.  It is possible to specify the
              propagation flags in <a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a> as mount options (<b>private</b>,
              <b>slave</b>, <b>shared</b>, <b>unbindable</b>, <b>rprivate</b>, <b>rslave</b>, <b>rshared</b>,
              <b>runbindable</b>).

              For example:

                     <b>mount --make-private --make-unbindable /dev/sda1 /foo</b>

              is the same as:

                     <b>mount /dev/sda1 /foo</b>
                     <b>mount --make-private /foo</b>
                     <b>mount --make-unbindable /foo</b>

<h2><a id="COMMAND-LINE_OPTIONS" href="#COMMAND-LINE_OPTIONS"></a>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The full set of mount options used by an invocation of <b>mount </b>is
       determined by first extracting the mount options for the filesystem
       from the <i>fstab</i> table, then applying any options specified by the <b>-o</b>
       argument, and finally applying a <b>-r </b>or <b>-w </b>option, when present.

       The command <b>mount </b>does not pass all command-line options to the
       <b>/sbin/mount.</b><i>suffix</i> mount helpers.  The interface between <b>mount </b>and
       the mount helpers is described below in the section EXTERNAL HELPERS.

       Command-line options available for the <b>mount </b>command are:

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
              Mount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned in <i>fstab</i>
              (except for those whose line contains the <b>noauto </b>keyword).
              The filesystems are mounted following their order in <i>fstab</i>.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--bind</b>
              Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its contents are
              available in both places).  See above.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--no-canonicalize</b>
              Don't canonicalize paths.  The mount command canonicalizes all
              paths (from command line or fstab) by default.  This option
              can be used together with the <b>-f </b>flag for already
              canonicalized absolute paths.  The option is designed for
              mount helpers which call <b>mount -i</b>.  It is strongly recommended
              to not use this command-line option for normal mount
              operations.

              Note that <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> does not pass this option to the
              <b>/sbin/mount.</b><i>type</i> helpers.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--fork</b>
              (Used in conjunction with <b>-a</b>.)  Fork off a new incarnation of
              <b>mount </b>for each device.  This will do the mounts on different
              devices or different NFS servers in parallel.  This has the
              advantage that it is faster; also NFS timeouts go in parallel.
              A disadvantage is that the mounts are done in undefined order.
              Thus, you cannot use this option if you want to mount both
              <i>/usr</i> and <i>/usr/spool</i>.

       <b>-f, --fake</b>
              Causes everything to be done except for the actual system
              call; if it's not obvious, this ``fakes'' mounting the
              filesystem.  This option is useful in conjunction with the <b>-v</b>
              flag to determine what the <b>mount </b>command is trying to do.  It
              can also be used to add entries for devices that were mounted
              earlier with the <b>-n </b>option.  The <b>-f </b>option checks for an
              existing record in /etc/mtab and fails when the record already
              exists (with a regular non-fake mount, this check is done by
              the kernel).

       <b>-i, --internal-only</b>
              Don't call the <b>/sbin/mount.</b><i>filesystem</i> helper even if it
              exists.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--label </b><i>label</i>
              Mount the partition that has the specified <i>label</i>.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--show-labels</b>
              Add the labels in the mount output.  <b>mount </b>must have
              permission to read the disk device (e.g. be suid root) for
              this to work.  One can set such a label for ext2, ext3 or ext4
              using the <a href="../man8/e2label.8.html">e2label(8)</a> utility, or for XFS using <a href="../man8/xfs_admin.8.html">xfs_admin(8)</a>,
              or for reiserfs using <b>reiserfstune</b>(8).

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--move</b>
              Move a subtree to some other place.  See above.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-mtab</b>
              Mount without writing in <i>/etc/mtab</i>.  This is necessary for
              example when <i>/etc</i> is on a read-only filesystem.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--test-opts </b><i>opts</i>
              Limit the set of filesystems to which the <b>-a </b>option applies.
              In this regard it is like the <b>-t </b>option except that <b>-O </b>is
              useless without <b>-a</b>.  For example, the command:

                     <b>mount -a -O no_netdev</b>

              mounts all filesystems except those which have the option
              <i>_netdev</i> specified in the options field in the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file.

              It is different from <b>-t </b>in that each option is matched
              exactly; a leading <b>no </b>at the beginning of one option does not
              negate the rest.

              The <b>-t </b>and <b>-O </b>options are cumulative in effect; that is, the
              command

                     <b>mount -a -t ext2 -O _netdev</b>

              mounts all ext2 filesystems with the _netdev option, not all
              filesystems that are either ext2 or have the _netdev option
              specified.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--options </b><i>opts</i>
              Use the specified mount options.  The <i>opts</i> argument is a
              comma-separated list.  For example:

                     <b>mount LABEL=mydisk -o noatime,nodev,nosuid</b>

              For more details, see the <b>FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS</b>
              and <b>FILESYSTEM-SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS </b>sections.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--rbind</b>
              Remount a subtree and all possible submounts somewhere else
              (so that its contents are available in both places).  See
              above.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--read-only</b>
              Mount the filesystem read-only.  A synonym is <b>-o ro</b>.

              Note that, depending on the filesystem type, state and kernel
              behavior, the system may still write to the device.  For
              example, ext3 and ext4 will replay the journal if the
              filesystem is dirty.  To prevent this kind of write access,
              you may want to mount an ext3 or ext4 filesystem with the
              <b>ro,noload </b>mount options or set the block device itself to
              read-only mode, see the <a href="../man8/blockdev.8.html">blockdev(8)</a> command.

       <b>-s     </b>Tolerate sloppy mount options rather than failing.  This will
              ignore mount options not supported by a filesystem type.  Not
              all filesystems support this option.  Currently it's supported
              by the <b>mount.nfs </b>mount helper only.

       <b>--source </b><i>device</i>
              If only one argument for the mount command is given then the
              argument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source
              (device).  This option allows to explicitly define that the
              argument is the mount source.

       <b>--target </b><i>directory</i>
              If only one argument for the mount command is given then the
              argument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source
              (device).  This option allows to explicitly define that the
              argument is the mount target.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--fstab </b><i>path</i>
              Specifies an alternative fstab file.  If <i>path</i> is a directory
              then the files in the directory are sorted by strverscmp(3);
              files that start with "." or without an .fstab extension are
              ignored.  The option can be specified more than once.  This
              option is mostly designed for initramfs or chroot scripts
              where additional configuration is specified beyond standard
              system configuration.

              Note that <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> does not pass the option <b>--fstab </b>to the
              <b>/sbin/mount.</b><i>type</i> helpers, meaning that the alternative fstab
              files will be invisible for the helpers.  This is no problem
              for normal mounts, but user (non-root) mounts always require
              fstab to verify the user's rights.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--types </b><i>fstype</i>
              The argument following the <b>-t </b>is used to indicate the
              filesystem type.  The filesystem types which are currently
              supported depend on the running kernel.  See <i>/proc/filesystems</i>
              and <i>/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/fs</i> for a complete list of
              the filesystems.  The most common are ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs,
              btrfs, vfat, sysfs, proc, nfs and cifs.

              The programs <b>mount </b>and <b>umount </b>support filesystem subtypes.
              The subtype is defined by a '.subtype' suffix.  For example
              'fuse.sshfs'.  It's recommended to use subtype notation rather
              than add any prefix to the mount source (for example
              'sshfs#example.com' is deprecated).

              If no <b>-t </b>option is given, or if the <b>auto </b>type is specified,
              mount will try to guess the desired type.  Mount uses the
              blkid library for guessing the filesystem type; if that does
              not turn up anything that looks familiar, mount will try to
              read the file <i>/etc/filesystems</i>, or, if that does not exist,
              <i>/proc/filesystems</i>.  All of the filesystem types listed there
              will be tried, except for those that are labeled "nodev"
              (e.g., <i>devpts</i>, <i>proc</i> and <i>nfs</i>).  If <i>/etc/filesystems</i> ends in a
              line with a single *, mount will read <i>/proc/filesystems</i>
              afterwards.  While trying, all filesystem types will be
              mounted with the mount option <b>silent</b>.

              The <b>auto </b>type may be useful for user-mounted floppies.
              Creating a file <i>/etc/filesystems</i> can be useful to change the
              probe order (e.g., to try vfat before msdos or ext3 before
              ext2) or if you use a kernel module autoloader.

              More than one type may be specified in a comma-separated list,
              for option <b>-t </b>as well as in an <i>/etc/fstab</i> entry.  The list of
              filesystem types for option <b>-t </b>can be prefixed with <b>no </b>to
              specify the filesystem types on which no action should be
              taken.  The prefix <b>no </b>has no effect when specified in an
              <i>/etc/fstab</i> entry.

              The prefix <b>no </b>can be meaningful with the <b>-a </b>option.  For
              example, the command

                     <b>mount -a -t nomsdos,smbfs</b>

              mounts all filesystems except those of type <i>msdos</i> and <i>smbfs</i>.

              For most types all the <b>mount </b>program has to do is issue a
              simple <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> system call, and no detailed knowledge of the
              filesystem type is required.  For a few types however (like
              nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs) an ad hoc code is necessary.
              The nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems have a
              separate mount program.  In order to make it possible to treat
              all types in a uniform way, <b>mount </b>will execute the program
              <b>/sbin/mount.</b><i>type</i> (if that exists) when called with type <i>type</i>.
              Since different versions of the <b>smbmount </b>program have
              different calling conventions, <b>/sbin/mount.smbfs </b>may have to
              be a shell script that sets up the desired call.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--uuid </b><i>uuid</i>
              Mount the partition that has the specified <i>uuid</i>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose mode.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--rw</b>, <b>--read-write</b>
              Mount the filesystem read/write.  This is the default.  A
              synonym is <b>-o rw</b>.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display help text and exit.

<h2><a id="FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT_MOUNT OPTIONS" href="#FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT_MOUNT OPTIONS"></a>FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Some of these options are only useful when they appear in the
       <i>/etc/fstab</i> file.

       Some of these options could be enabled or disabled by default in the
       system kernel.  To check the current setting see the options in
       /proc/mounts.  Note that filesystems also have per-filesystem
       specific default mount options (see for example <b>tune2fs -l </b>output for
       extN filesystems).

       The following options apply to any filesystem that is being mounted
       (but not every filesystem actually honors them â€“ e.g., the <b>sync</b>
       option today has an effect only for ext2, ext3, fat, vfat and ufs):

       <b>async  </b>All I/O to the filesystem should be done asynchronously.  (See
              also the <b>sync </b>option.)

       <b>atime  </b>Do not use the noatime feature, so the inode access time is
              controlled by kernel defaults.  See also the descriptions of
              the <b>strictatime </b>and <b>relatime </b>mount options.

       <b>noatime</b>
              Do not update inode access times on this filesystem (e.g., for
              faster access on the news spool to speed up news servers).
              This works for all inode types (directories too), so implies
              nodiratime.

       <b>auto   </b>Can be mounted with the <b>-a </b>option.

       <b>noauto </b>Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the <b>-a </b>option will not
              cause the filesystem to be mounted).

       <b>context=</b><i>context</i>, <b>fscontext=</b>/<i>context</i>, <b>defcontext=</b>/<i>context</i> and
       <b>rootcontext=</b><i>context</i>
              The <b>context= </b>option is useful when mounting filesystems that
              do not support extended attributes, such as a floppy or hard
              disk formatted with VFAT, or systems that are not normally
              running under SELinux, such as an ext3 formatted disk from a
              non-SELinux workstation.  You can also use <b>context= </b>on
              filesystems you do not trust, such as a floppy.  It also helps
              in compatibility with xattr-supporting filesystems on earlier
              2.4.&lt;x&gt; kernel versions.  Even where xattrs are supported, you
              can save time not having to label every file by assigning the
              entire disk one security context.

              A commonly used option for removable media is
              <b>context="system_u:object_r:removable_t"</b>.

              Two other options are <b>fscontext= </b>and <b>defcontext=</b>, both of
              which are mutually exclusive of the context option.  This
              means you can use fscontext and defcontext with each other,
              but neither can be used with context.

              The <b>fscontext= </b>option works for all filesystems, regardless of
              their xattr support.  The fscontext option sets the
              overarching filesystem label to a specific security context.
              This filesystem label is separate from the individual labels
              on the files.  It represents the entire filesystem for certain
              kinds of permission checks, such as during mount or file
              creation.  Individual file labels are still obtained from the
              xattrs on the files themselves.  The context option actually
              sets the aggregate context that fscontext provides, in
              addition to supplying the same label for individual files.

              You can set the default security context for unlabeled files
              using <b>defcontext= </b>option.  This overrides the value set for
              unlabeled files in the policy and requires a filesystem that
              supports xattr labeling.

              The <b>rootcontext= </b>option allows you to explicitly label the
              root inode of a FS being mounted before that FS or inode
              becomes visible to userspace.  This was found to be useful for
              things like stateless linux.

              Note that the kernel rejects any remount request that includes
              the context option, <b>even </b>when unchanged from the current
              context.

              <b>Warning: the </b><i>context</i> <b>value might contain commas</b>, in which case
              the value has to be properly quoted, otherwise <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> will
              interpret the comma as a separator between mount options.
              Don't forget that the shell strips off quotes and thus <b>double</b>
              <b>quoting is required</b>.  For example:

                     <b>mount -t tmpfs none /mnt -o \</b>
                     <b>'context="system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0:c127,c456",noexec'</b>

              For more details, see <a href="../man8/selinux.8.html">selinux(8)</a>.

       <b>defaults</b>
              Use the default options: <b>rw</b>, <b>suid</b>, <b>dev</b>, <b>exec</b>, <b>auto</b>, <b>nouser</b>,
              and <b>async</b>.

              Note that the real set of all default mount options depends on
              kernel and filesystem type.  See the beginning of this section
              for more details.

       <b>dev    </b>Interpret character or block special devices on the
              filesystem.

       <b>nodev  </b>Do not interpret character or block special devices on the
              file system.

       <b>diratime</b>
              Update directory inode access times on this filesystem.  This
              is the default.  Directory inode will not be updated when
              noatime is set, regardless of this option.

       <b>nodiratime</b>
              Do not update directory inode access times on this filesystem.
              If noatime option is set, this option is not needed.

       <b>dirsync</b>
              All directory updates within the filesystem should be done
              synchronously.  This affects the following system calls:
              creat, link, unlink, symlink, mkdir, rmdir, mknod and rename.

       <b>exec   </b>Permit execution of binaries.

       <b>noexec </b>Do not permit direct execution of any binaries on the mounted
              filesystem.  (Until recently it was possible to run binaries
              anyway using a command like /lib/ld*.so /mnt/binary.  This
              trick fails since Linux 2.4.25 / 2.6.0.)

       <b>group  </b>Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem if one of that
              user's groups matches the group of the device.  This option
              implies the options <b>nosuid </b>and <b>nodev </b>(unless overridden by
              subsequent options, as in the option line <b>group,dev,suid</b>).

       <b>iversion</b>
              Every time the inode is modified, the i_version field will be
              incremented.

       <b>noiversion</b>
              Do not increment the i_version inode field.

       <b>mand   </b>Allow mandatory locks on this filesystem.  See <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.

       <b>nomand </b>Do not allow mandatory locks on this filesystem.

       <b>_netdev</b>
              The filesystem resides on a device that requires network
              access (used to prevent the system from attempting to mount
              these filesystems until the network has been enabled on the
              system).

       <b>nofail </b>Do not report errors for this device if it does not exist.

       <b>relatime</b>
              Update inode access times relative to modify or change time.
              Access time is only updated if the previous access time was
              earlier than the current modify or change time.  (Similar to
              <b>noatime</b>, but it doesn't break <b>mutt </b>or other applications that
              need to know if a file has been read since the last time it
              was modified.)

              Since Linux 2.6.30, the kernel defaults to the behavior
              provided by this option (unless <b>noatime </b>was specified), and
              the <b>strictatime </b>option is required to obtain traditional
              semantics.  In addition, since Linux 2.6.30, the file's last
              access time is always updated if it is more than 1 day old.

       <b>norelatime</b>
              Do not use the <b>relatime </b>feature.  See also the <b>strictatime</b>
              mount option.

       <b>strictatime</b>
              Allows to explicitly request full atime updates.  This makes
              it possible for the kernel to default to <b>relatime </b>or <b>noatime</b>
              but still allow userspace to override it.  For more details
              about the default system mount options see /proc/mounts.

       <b>nostrictatime</b>
              Use the kernel's default behavior for inode access time
              updates.

       <b>lazytime</b>
              Only update times (atime, mtime, ctime) on the in-memory
              version of the file inode.

              This mount option significantly reduces writes to the inode
              table for workloads that perform frequent random writes to
              preallocated files.

              The on-disk timestamps are updated only when:

              - the inode needs to be updated for some change unrelated to
              file timestamps

              - the application employs <a href="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/syncfs.2.html">syncfs(2)</a>, or <a href="../man2/sync.2.html">sync(2)</a>

              - an undeleted inode is evicted from memory

              - more than 24 hours have passed since the i-node was written
              to disk.

       <b>nolazytime</b>
              Do not use the lazytime feature.

       <b>suid   </b>Allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take
              effect.

       <b>nosuid </b>Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits
              to take effect.

       <b>silent </b>Turn on the silent flag.

       <b>loud   </b>Turn off the silent flag.

       <b>owner  </b>Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem if that user is
              the owner of the device.  This option implies the options
              <b>nosuid </b>and <b>nodev </b>(unless overridden by subsequent options, as
              in the option line <b>owner,dev,suid</b>).

       <b>remount</b>
              Attempt to remount an already-mounted filesystem.  This is
              commonly used to change the mount flags for a filesystem,
              especially to make a readonly filesystem writable.  It does
              not change device or mount point.

              The remount functionality follows the standard way the mount
              command works with options from fstab.  This means that the
              mount command only doesn't read fstab (or mtab) when both the
              <i>device</i> and <i>dir</i> are specified.

              <b>mount -o remount,rw /dev/foo /dir</b>

              After this call all old mount options are replaced and
              arbitrary stuff from fstab (or mtab) is ignored, except the
              loop= option which is internally generated and maintained by
              the mount command.

              <b>mount -o remount,rw  /dir</b>

              After this call mount reads fstab and merges these options
              with the options from the command line (<b>-o</b>). If no mountpoint
              found in fstab than remount with unspecified source is
              allowed.

       <b>ro     </b>Mount the filesystem read-only.

       <b>rw     </b>Mount the filesystem read-write.

       <b>sync   </b>All I/O to the filesystem should be done synchronously.  In
              the case of media with a limited number of write cycles (e.g.
              some flash drives), <b>sync </b>may cause life-cycle shortening.

       <b>user   </b>Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem.  The name of
              the mounting user is written to the mtab file (or to the
              private libmount file in /run/mount on systems without a
              regular mtab) so that this same user can unmount the
              filesystem again.  This option implies the options <b>noexec</b>,
              <b>nosuid</b>, and <b>nodev </b>(unless overridden by subsequent options, as
              in the option line <b>user,exec,dev,suid</b>).

       <b>nouser </b>Forbid an ordinary user to mount the filesystem.  This is the
              default; it does not imply any other options.

       <b>users  </b>Allow any user to mount and to unmount the filesystem, even
              when some other ordinary user mounted it.  This option implies
              the options <b>noexec</b>, <b>nosuid</b>, and <b>nodev </b>(unless overridden by
              subsequent options, as in the option line
              <b>users,exec,dev,suid</b>).

       <b>x-*    </b>All options prefixed with "x-" are interpreted as comments or
              as userspace application-specific options.  These options are
              not stored in the mtab file, nor sent to the mount.<i>type</i>
              helpers nor to the <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> system call.  The suggested format
              is <b>x-</b><i>appname</i>.<i>option</i> (e.g. <b>x-systemd.automount</b>).

       <b>x-mount.mkdir</b>[<b>=</b><i>mode</i><b>]</b>
              Allow to make a target directory (mountpoint).  The optional
              argument <i>mode</i> specifies the filesystem access mode used for
              <a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir(2)</a> in octal notation.  The default mode is 0755.  This
              functionality is supported only for root users.

<h2><a id="Mount_options for btrfs" href="#Mount_options for btrfs"></a>Mount options for btrfs  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Btrfs is a copy-on-write filesystem for Linux aimed at implementing
       advanced features while focusing on fault tolerance, repair, and easy
       administration.

       <b>alloc_start=</b><i>bytes</i>
              Debugging option to force all block allocations above a
              certain byte threshold on each block device.  The value is
              specified in bytes, optionally with a K, M, or G suffix, case
              insensitive.  Default is 1MB.

       <b>autodefrag</b>
              Disable/enable auto defragmentation.  Auto defragmentation
              detects small random writes into files and queues them up for
              the defrag process.  Works best for small files; not well-
              suited for large database workloads.

       <b>check_int</b>|<b>check_int_data</b>|<b>check_int_print_mask</b>=<i>value</i>
              These debugging options control the behavior of the integrity
              checking module(the BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY config option
              required).

              <b>check_int </b>enables the integrity checker module, which examines
              all block-write requests to ensure on-disk consistency, at a
              large memory and CPU cost.

              <b>check_int_data </b>includes extent data in the integrity checks,
              and implies the check_int option.

              <b>check_int_print_mask </b>takes a bitmask of BTRFSIC_PRINT_MASK_*
              values as defined in fs/btrfs/check-integrity.c, to control
              the integrity checker module behavior.

              See comments at the top of <i>fs/btrfs/check-integrity.c</i> for more
              info.

       <b>commit=</b><i>seconds</i>
              Set the interval of periodic commit, 30 seconds by default.
              Higher values defer data being synced to permanent storage,
              with obvious consequences when the system crashes.  The upper
              bound is not forced, but a warning is printed if it's more
              than 300 seconds (5 minutes).

       <b>compress</b>|<b>compress=</b><i>type</i>|<b>compress-force</b>|<b>compress-force=</b><i>type</i>
              Control BTRFS file data compression.  Type may be specified as
              "zlib" "lzo" or "no" (for no compression, used for
              remounting).  If no type is specified, zlib is used.  If
              <b>compress-force </b>is specified, all files will be compressed,
              whether or not they compress well.  If compression is enabled,
              <b>nodatacow </b>and <b>nodatasum </b>are disabled.

       <b>degraded</b>
              Allow mounts to continue with missing devices.  A read-write
              mount may fail with too many devices missing, for example if a
              stripe member is completely missing.

       <b>device=</b><i>devicepath</i>
              Specify a device during mount so that ioctls on the control
              device can be avoided.  Especially useful when trying to mount
              a multi-device setup as root.  May be specified multiple times
              for multiple devices.

       <b>discard</b>
              Disable/enable the discard mount option.  The discard function
              issues frequent commands to let the block device reclaim space
              freed by the filesystem.  This is useful for SSD devices,
              thinly provisioned LUNs and virtual machine images, but may
              have a significant performance impact.  (The <b>fstrim </b>command is
              also available to initiate batch trims from userspace.)

       <b>enospc_debug</b>
              Disable/enable debugging option to be more verbose in some
              ENOSPC conditions.

       <b>fatal_errors=</b><i>action</i>
              Action to take when encountering a fatal error:
                "bug" - BUG() on a fatal error.  This is the default.
                "panic" - panic() on a fatal error.

       <b>flushoncommit</b>
              The <b>flushoncommit </b>mount option forces any data dirtied by a
              write in a prior transaction to commit as part of the current
              commit.  This makes the committed state a fully consistent
              view of the filesystem from the application's perspective
              (i.e., it includes all completed filesystem operations).  This
              was previously the behavior only when a snapshot is created.

       <b>inode_cache</b>
              Enable free inode number caching.   Defaults to off due to an
              overflow problem when the free space CRCs don't fit inside a
              single page.

       <b>max_inline=</b><i>bytes</i>
              Specify the maximum amount of space, in bytes, that can be
              inlined in a metadata B-tree leaf.  The value is specified in
              bytes, optionally with a K, M, or G suffix, case insensitive.
              In practice, this value is limited by the root sector size,
              with some space unavailable due to leaf headers.  For a 4k
              sectorsize, max inline data is ~3900 bytes.

       <b>metadata_ratio=</b><i>value</i>
              Specify that 1 metadata chunk should be allocated after every
              <i>value</i> data chunks.  Off by default.

       <b>noacl  </b>Enable/disable support for Posix Access Control Lists (ACLs).
              See the <a href="../man5/acl.5.html">acl(5)</a> manual page for more information about ACLs.

       <b>nobarrier</b>
              Enable/disable the use of block-layer write barriers.  Write
              barriers ensure that certain IOs make it through the device
              cache and are on persistent storage.  If disabled on a device
              with a volatile (non-battery-backed) write-back cache, the
              <b>nobarrier </b>option will lead to filesystem corruption on a
              system crash or power loss.

       <b>nodatacow</b>
              Enable/disable data copy-on-write for newly created files.
              This option implies <b>nodatasum</b>, and disables all compression.

       <b>nodatasum</b>
              Enable/disable data checksumming for newly created files.
              This option implies <b>datacow</b>.

       <b>notreelog</b>
              Enable/disable the tree logging used for fsync and O_SYNC
              writes.

       <b>recovery</b>
              Enable autorecovery attempts if a bad tree root is found at
              mount time.  Currently this scans a list of several previous
              tree roots and tries to use the first readable.

       <b>rescan_uuid_tree</b>
              Force check and rebuild procedure of the UUID tree.  This
              should not normally be needed.

       <b>skip_balance</b>
              Skip automatic resume of an interrupted balance operation
              after mount.  May be resumed with "btrfs balance resume."

       <b>nospace_cache</b>
              Disable freespace cache loading without clearing the cache.

       <b>clear_cache</b>
              Force clearing and rebuilding of the disk space cache if
              something has gone wrong.

       <b>ssd</b>|<b>nossd</b>|<b>ssd_spread</b>
              Options to control ssd allocation schemes.  By default, BTRFS
              will enable or disable ssd allocation heuristics depending on
              whether a rotational or nonrotational disk is in use.  The <b>ssd</b>
              and <b>nossd </b>options can override this autodetection.

              The <b>ssd_spread </b>mount option attempts to allocate into big
              chunks of unused space, and may perform better on low-end
              ssds.  <b>ssd_spread </b>implies <b>ssd</b>, enabling all other ssd
              heuristics as well.

       <b>subvol=</b><i>path</i>
              Mount subvolume at <i>path</i> rather than the root subvolume.  The
              <i>path</i> is relative to the top level subvolume.

       <b>subvolid=</b><i>ID</i>
              Mount subvolume specified by an ID number rather than the root
              subvolume.  This allows mounting of subvolumes which are not
              in the root of the mounted filesystem.  You can use "btrfs
              subvolume list" to see subvolume ID numbers.

       <b>subvolrootid=</b><i>objectid</i>  (deprecated)
              Mount subvolume specified by <i>objectid</i> rather than the root
              subvolume.  This allows mounting of subvolumes which are not
              in the root of the mounted filesystem.  You can use "btrfs
              subvolume show " to see the object ID for a subvolume.

       <b>thread_pool=</b><i>number</i>
              The number of worker threads to allocate.  The default number
              is equal to the number of CPUs + 2, or 8, whichever is
              smaller.

       <b>user_subvol_rm_allowed</b>
              Allow subvolumes to be deleted by a non-root user.  Use with
              caution.

       The debugfs filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally mounted
       on <i>/sys/kernel/debug</i>.  As of kernel version 3.4, debugfs has the
       following options:

       <b>uid=</b><i>n</i><b>, gid=</b><i>n</i>
              Set the owner and group of the mountpoint.

       <b>mode=</b><i>value</i>
              Sets the mode of the mountpoint.

<h2><a id="Mount_options for devpts" href="#Mount_options for devpts"></a>Mount options for devpts  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The devpts filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally mounted
       on <i>/dev/pts</i>.  In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens
       <i>/dev/ptmx</i>; the number of the pseudo terminal is then made available
       to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as
       <i>/dev/pts/</i>&lt;number&gt;.

       <b>uid=</b><i>value</i> and <b>gid=</b><i>value</i>
              This sets the owner or the group of newly created PTYs to the
              specified values.  When nothing is specified, they will be set
              to the UID and GID of the creating process.  For example, if
              there is a tty group with GID 5, then <b>gid=5 </b>will cause newly
              created PTYs to belong to the tty group.

       <b>mode=</b><i>value</i>
              Set the mode of newly created PTYs to the specified value.
              The default is 0600.  A value of <b>mode=620 </b>and <b>gid=5 </b>makes
              "mesg y" the default on newly created PTYs.

       <b>newinstance</b>
              Create a private instance of devpts filesystem, such that
              indices of ptys allocated in this new instance are independent
              of indices created in other instances of devpts.

              All mounts of devpts without this <b>newinstance </b>option share the
              same set of pty indices (i.e legacy mode).  Each mount of
              devpts with the <b>newinstance </b>option has a private set of pty
              indices.

              This option is mainly used to support containers in the linux
              kernel.  It is implemented in linux kernel versions starting
              with 2.6.29.  Further, this mount option is valid only if
              CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES is enabled in the kernel
              configuration.

              To use this option effectively, <i>/dev/ptmx</i> must be a symbolic
              link to <i>pts/ptmx.</i>  See <i>Documentation/filesystems/devpts.txt</i> in
              the linux kernel source tree for details.

       <b>ptmxmode=</b><i>value</i>

              Set the mode for the new <i>ptmx</i> device node in the devpts
              filesystem.

              With the support for multiple instances of devpts (see
              <b>newinstance </b>option above), each instance has a private <i>ptmx</i>
              node in the root of the devpts filesystem (typically
              <i>/dev/pts/ptmx</i>).

              For compatibility with older versions of the kernel, the
              default mode of the new <i>ptmx</i> node is 0000.  <b>ptmxmode=</b><i>value</i>
              specifies a more useful mode for the <i>ptmx</i> node and is highly
              recommended when the <b>newinstance </b>option is specified.

              This option is only implemented in linux kernel versions
              starting with 2.6.29.  Further, this option is valid only if
              CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES is enabled in the kernel
              configuration.

       The `ext2' filesystem is the standard Linux filesystem.  Since Linux
       2.5.46, for most mount options the default is determined by the
       filesystem superblock.  Set them with <a href="../man8/tune2fs.8.html">tune2fs(8)</a>.

       <b>acl</b>|<b>noacl</b>
              Support POSIX Access Control Lists (or not).

       <b>bsddf</b>|<b>minixdf</b>
              Set the behavior for the <i>statfs</i> system call.  The <b>minixdf</b>
              behavior is to return in the <i>f_blocks</i> field the total number
              of blocks of the filesystem, while the <b>bsddf </b>behavior (which
              is the default) is to subtract the overhead blocks used by the
              ext2 filesystem and not available for file storage.  Thus

              % mount /k -o minixdf; df /k; umount /k

              Filesystem  1024-blocks   Used  Available  Capacity  Mounted on

              % mount /k -o bsddf; df /k; umount /k

              (Note that this example shows that one can add command-line
              options to the options given in <i>/etc/fstab</i>.)

       <b>check=none </b>or <b>nocheck</b>
              No checking is done at mount time.  This is the default.  This
              is fast.  It is wise to invoke <a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> every now and then,
              e.g. at boot time.  The non-default behavior is unsupported
              (check=normal and check=strict options have been removed).
              Note that these mount options don't have to be supported if
              ext4 kernel driver is used for ext2 and ext3 filesystems.

       <b>debug  </b>Print debugging info upon each (re)mount.

       <b>errors=</b>{<b>continue</b>|<b>remount-ro</b>|<b>panic</b>}
              Define the behavior when an error is encountered.  (Either
              ignore errors and just mark the filesystem erroneous and
              continue, or remount the filesystem read-only, or panic and
              halt the system.)  The default is set in the filesystem
              superblock, and can be changed using <a href="../man8/tune2fs.8.html">tune2fs(8)</a>.

       <b>grpid</b>|<b>bsdgroups </b>and <b>nogrpid</b>|<b>sysvgroups</b>
              These options define what group id a newly created file gets.
              When <b>grpid </b>is set, it takes the group id of the directory in
              which it is created; otherwise (the default) it takes the
              fsgid of the current process, unless the directory has the
              setgid bit set, in which case it takes the gid from the parent
              directory, and also gets the setgid bit set if it is a
              directory itself.

       <b>grpquota</b>|<b>noquota</b>|<b>quota</b>|<b>usrquota</b>
              The usrquota (same as quota) mount option enables user quota
              support on the filesystem.  grpquota enables group quotas
              support.  You need the quota utilities to actually enable and
              manage the quota system.

       <b>nouid32</b>
              Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs.  This is for interoperability
              with older kernels which only store and expect 16-bit values.

       <b>oldalloc </b>or <b>orlov</b>
              Use old allocator or Orlov allocator for new inodes.  Orlov is
              default.

       <b>resgid=</b><i>n</i> and <b>resuid=</b><i>n</i>
              The ext2 filesystem reserves a certain percentage of the
              available space (by default 5%, see <a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a> and <a href="../man8/tune2fs.8.html">tune2fs(8)</a>).
              These options determine who can use the reserved blocks.
              (Roughly: whoever has the specified uid, or belongs to the
              specified group.)

       <b>sb=</b><i>n</i>   Instead of block 1, use block <i>n</i> as superblock.  This could be
              useful when the filesystem has been damaged.  (Earlier, copies
              of the superblock would be made every 8192 blocks: in block 1,
              8193, 16385, ... (and one got thousands of copies on a big
              filesystem).  Since version 1.08, <b>mke2fs </b>has a -s (sparse
              superblock) option to reduce the number of backup superblocks,
              and since version 1.15 this is the default.  Note that this
              may mean that ext2 filesystems created by a recent <b>mke2fs</b>
              cannot be mounted r/w under Linux 2.0.*.)  The block number
              here uses 1 k units.  Thus, if you want to use logical block
              32768 on a filesystem with 4 k blocks, use "sb=131072".

       <b>user_xattr</b>|<b>nouser_xattr</b>
              Support "user." extended attributes (or not).

<h2><a id="Mount_options for ext3" href="#Mount_options for ext3"></a>Mount options for ext3  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The ext3 filesystem is a version of the ext2 filesystem which has
       been enhanced with journaling.  It supports the same options as ext2
       as well as the following additions:

       <b>journal=update</b>
              Update the ext3 filesystem's journal to the current format.

       <b>journal=inum</b>
              When a journal already exists, this option is ignored.
              Otherwise, it specifies the number of the inode which will
              represent the ext3 filesystem's journal file; ext3 will create
              a new journal, overwriting the old contents of the file whose
              inode number is <i>inum</i>.

       <b>journal_dev=devnum</b>/<b>journal_path=path</b>
              When the external journal device's major/minor numbers have
              changed, these options allow the user to specify the new
              journal location.  The journal device is identified either
              through its new major/minor numbers encoded in devnum, or via
              a path to the device.

       <b>norecovery</b>/<b>noload</b>
              Don't load the journal on mounting.  Note that if the
              filesystem was not unmounted cleanly, skipping the journal
              replay will lead to the filesystem containing inconsistencies
              that can lead to any number of problems.

       <b>data=</b>{<b>journal</b>|<b>ordered</b>|<b>writeback</b>}
              Specifies the journaling mode for file data.  Metadata is
              always journaled.  To use modes other than <b>ordered </b>on the root
              filesystem, pass the mode to the kernel as boot parameter,
              e.g. <i>rootflags=data=journal</i>.

              <b>journal</b>
                     All data is committed into the journal prior to being
                     written into the main filesystem.

              <b>ordered</b>
                     This is the default mode.  All data is forced directly
                     out to the main file system prior to its metadata being
                     committed to the journal.

              <b>writeback</b>
                     Data ordering is not preserved â€“ data may be written
                     into the main filesystem after its metadata has been
                     committed to the journal.  This is rumoured to be the
                     highest-throughput option.  It guarantees internal
                     filesystem integrity, however it can allow old data to
                     appear in files after a crash and journal recovery.

       <b>data_err=ignore</b>
              Just print an error message if an error occurs in a file data
              buffer in ordered mode.

       <b>data_err=abort</b>
              Abort the journal if an error occurs in a file data buffer in
              ordered mode.

       <b>barrier=0 </b>/ <b>barrier=1</b>
              This disables / enables the use of write barriers in the jbd
              code.  barrier=0 disables, barrier=1 enables (default).  This
              also requires an IO stack which can support barriers, and if
              jbd gets an error on a barrier write, it will disable barriers
              again with a warning.  Write barriers enforce proper on-disk
              ordering of journal commits, making volatile disk write caches
              safe to use, at some performance penalty.  If your disks are
              battery-backed in one way or another, disabling barriers may
              safely improve performance.

       <b>commit=</b><i>nrsec</i>
              Sync all data and metadata every <i>nrsec</i> seconds.  The default
              value is 5 seconds.  Zero means default.

       <b>user_xattr</b>
              Enable Extended User Attributes.  See the <a href="../man5/attr.5.html">attr(5)</a> manual page.

       <b>acl    </b>Enable POSIX Access Control Lists.  See the <a href="../man5/acl.5.html">acl(5)</a> manual
              page.

       <b>usrjquota=aquota.user</b>|<b>grpjquota=aquota.group</b>|<b>jqfmt=vfsv0</b>
              Apart from the old quota system (as in ext2, jqfmt=vfsold aka
              version 1 quota) ext3 also supports journaled quotas (version
              2 quota).  jqfmt=vfsv0 enables journaled quotas.  For
              journaled quotas the mount options usrjquota=aquota.user and
              grpjquota=aquota.group are required to tell the quota system
              which quota database files to use.  Journaled quotas have the
              advantage that even after a crash no quota check is required.

<h2><a id="Mount_options for ext4" href="#Mount_options for ext4"></a>Mount options for ext4  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The ext4 filesystem is an advanced level of the ext3 filesystem which
       incorporates scalability and reliability enhancements for supporting
       large filesystem.

       The options <b>journal_dev, norecovery, noload, data, commit, orlov,</b>
       <b>oldalloc, [no]user_xattr [no]acl, bsddf, minixdf, debug, errors,</b>
       <b>data_err, grpid, bsdgroups, nogrpid sysvgroups, resgid, resuid, sb,</b>
       <b>quota, noquota, grpquota, usrquota usrjquota, grpjquota and jqfmt </b>are
       backwardly compatible with ext3 or ext2.

       <b>journal_checksum</b>
              Enable checksumming of the journal transactions.  This will
              allow the recovery code in e2fsck and the kernel to detect
              corruption in the kernel.  It is a compatible change and will
              be ignored by older kernels.

       <b>journal_async_commit</b>
              Commit block can be written to disk without waiting for
              descriptor blocks.  If enabled, older kernels cannot mount the
              device.  This will enable 'journal_checksum' internally.

       <b>barrier=0 </b>/ <b>barrier=1 </b>/ <b>barrier </b>/ <b>nobarrier</b>
              These mount options have the same effect as in ext3.  The
              mount options "barrier" and "nobarrier" are added for
              consistency with other ext4 mount options.

              The ext4 filesystem enables write barriers by default.

       <b>inode_readahead_blks=</b><i>n</i>
              This tuning parameter controls the maximum number of inode
              table blocks that ext4's inode table readahead algorithm will
              pre-read into the buffer cache.  The value must be a power of
              2.  The default value is 32 blocks.

       <b>stripe=</b><i>n</i>
              Number of filesystem blocks that mballoc will try to use for
              allocation size and alignment.  For RAID5/6 systems this
              should be the number of data disks * RAID chunk size in
              filesystem blocks.

       <b>delalloc</b>
              Deferring block allocation until write-out time.

       <b>nodelalloc</b>
              Disable delayed allocation.  Blocks are allocated when data is
              copied from user to page cache.

       <b>max_batch_time=</b><i>usec</i>
              Maximum amount of time ext4 should wait for additional
              filesystem operations to be batch together with a synchronous
              write operation.  Since a synchronous write operation is going
              to force a commit and then a wait for the I/O complete, it
              doesn't cost much, and can be a huge throughput win, we wait
              for a small amount of time to see if any other transactions
              can piggyback on the synchronous write.  The algorithm used is
              designed to automatically tune for the speed of the disk, by
              measuring the amount of time (on average) that it takes to
              finish committing a transaction.  Call this time the "commit
              time".  If the time that the transaction has been running is
              less than the commit time, ext4 will try sleeping for the
              commit time to see if other operations will join the
              transaction.  The commit time is capped by the max_batch_time,
              which defaults to 15000 Âµs (15 ms).  This optimization can be
              turned off entirely by setting max_batch_time to 0.

       <b>min_batch_time=</b><i>usec</i>
              This parameter sets the commit time (as described above) to be
              at least min_batch_time.  It defaults to zero microseconds.
              Increasing this parameter may improve the throughput of multi-
              threaded, synchronous workloads on very fast disks, at the
              cost of increasing latency.

       <b>journal_ioprio=</b><i>prio</i>
              The I/O priority (from 0 to 7, where 0 is the highest
              priority) which should be used for I/O operations submitted by
              kjournald2 during a commit operation.  This defaults to 3,
              which is a slightly higher priority than the default I/O
              priority.

       <b>abort  </b>Simulate the effects of calling ext4_abort() for debugging
              purposes.  This is normally used while remounting a filesystem
              which is already mounted.

       <b>auto_da_alloc</b>|<b>noauto_da_alloc</b>
              Many broken applications don't use fsync() when replacing
              existing files via patterns such as

              fd = open("foo.new")/write(fd,...)/close(fd)/
              rename("foo.new", "foo")

              or worse yet

              fd = open("foo", O_TRUNC)/write(fd,...)/close(fd).

              If auto_da_alloc is enabled, ext4 will detect the replace-via-
              rename and replace-via-truncate patterns and force that any
              delayed allocation blocks are allocated such that at the next
              journal commit, in the default data=ordered mode, the data
              blocks of the new file are forced to disk before the rename()
              operation is committed.  This provides roughly the same level
              of guarantees as ext3, and avoids the "zero-length" problem
              that can happen when a system crashes before the delayed
              allocation blocks are forced to disk.

       <b>noinit_itable</b>
              Do not initialize any uninitialized inode table blocks in the
              background.  This feature may be used by installation CD's so
              that the install process can complete as quickly as possible;
              the inode table initialization process would then be deferred
              until the next time the filesystem is mounted.

       <b>init_itable=n</b>
              The lazy itable init code will wait n times the number of
              milliseconds it took to zero out the previous block group's
              inode table.  This minimizes the impact on system performance
              while the filesystem's inode table is being initialized.

       <b>discard</b>/<b>nodiscard</b>
              Controls whether ext4 should issue discard/TRIM commands to
              the underlying block device when blocks are freed.  This is
              useful for SSD devices and sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs, but
              it is off by default until sufficient testing has been done.

       <b>nouid32</b>
              Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs.  This is for interoperability
              with older kernels which only store and expect 16-bit values.

       <b>block_validity</b>/<b>noblock_validity</b>
              This options allows to enables/disables the in-kernel facility
              for tracking filesystem metadata blocks within internal data
              structures.  This allows multi-block allocator and other
              routines to quickly locate extents which might overlap with
              filesystem metadata blocks.  This option is intended for
              debugging purposes and since it negatively affects the
              performance, it is off by default.

       <b>dioread_lock</b>/<b>dioread_nolock</b>
              Controls whether or not ext4 should use the DIO read locking.
              If the dioread_nolock option is specified ext4 will allocate
              uninitialized extent before buffer write and convert the
              extent to initialized after IO completes.  This approach
              allows ext4 code to avoid using inode mutex, which improves
              scalability on high speed storages.  However this does not
              work with data journaling and dioread_nolock option will be
              ignored with kernel warning.  Note that dioread_nolock code
              path is only used for extent-based files.  Because of the
              restrictions this options comprises it is off by default (e.g.
              dioread_lock).

       <b>max_dir_size_kb=n</b>
              This limits the size of the directories so that any attempt to
              expand them beyond the specified limit in kilobytes will cause
              an ENOSPC error.  This is useful in memory-constrained
              environments, where a very large directory can cause severe
              performance problems or even provoke the Out Of Memory killer.
              (For example, if there is only 512 MB memory available, a
              176 MB directory may seriously cramp the system's style.)

       <b>i_version</b>
              Enable 64-bit inode version support.  This option is off by
              default.

       (Note: <i>fat</i> is not a separate filesystem, but a common part of the
       <i>msdos</i>, <i>umsdos</i> and <i>vfat</i> filesystems.)

       <b>blocksize=</b>{<b>512</b>|<b>1024</b>|<b>2048</b>}
              Set blocksize (default 512).  This option is obsolete.

       <b>uid=</b><i>value</i> and <b>gid=</b><i>value</i>
              Set the owner and group of all files.  (Default: the uid and
              gid of the current process.)

       <b>umask=</b><i>value</i>
              Set the umask (the bitmask of the permissions that are <b>not</b>
              present).  The default is the umask of the current process.
              The value is given in octal.

       <b>dmask=</b><i>value</i>
              Set the umask applied to directories only.  The default is the
              umask of the current process.  The value is given in octal.

       <b>fmask=</b><i>value</i>
              Set the umask applied to regular files only.  The default is
              the umask of the current process.  The value is given in
              octal.

       <b>allow_utime=</b><i>value</i>
              This option controls the permission check of mtime/atime.

              <b>20     </b>If current process is in group of file's group ID, you
                     can change timestamp.

              <b>2      </b>Other users can change timestamp.

              The default is set from `dmask' option. (If the directory is
              writable, <a href="../man2/utime.2.html">utime(2)</a> is also allowed.  I.e. ~dmask &amp; 022)

              Normally <a href="../man2/utime.2.html">utime(2)</a> checks current process is owner of the file,
              or it has CAP_FOWNER capability.  But FAT filesystem doesn't
              have uid/gid on disk, so normal check is too inflexible.  With
              this option you can relax it.

       <b>check=</b><i>value</i>
              Three different levels of pickiness can be chosen:

              <b>r</b>[<b>elaxed</b>]
                     Upper and lower case are accepted and equivalent, long
                     name parts are truncated (e.g. <i>verylongname.foobar</i>
                     becomes <i>verylong.foo</i>), leading and embedded spaces are
                     accepted in each name part (name and extension).

              <b>n</b>[<b>ormal</b>]
                     Like "relaxed", but many special characters (*, ?, &lt;,
                     spaces, etc.) are rejected.  This is the default.

              <b>s</b>[<b>trict</b>]
                     Like "normal", but names that contain long parts or
                     special characters that are sometimes used on Linux but
                     are not accepted by MS-DOS (+, =, etc.) are rejected.

       <b>codepage=</b><i>value</i>
              Sets the codepage for converting to shortname characters on
              FAT and VFAT filesystems.  By default, codepage 437 is used.

       <b>conv=</b><i>mode</i>
              The <i>fat</i> filesystem can perform CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL conversion (MS-DOS
              text format to UNIX text format) in the kernel.  The following
              conversion <i>mode</i>s are available:

              <b>b</b>[<b>inary</b>]
                     No translation is performed.  This is the default.

              <b>t</b>[<b>ext</b>] CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL translation is performed on all files.

              <b>a</b>[<b>uto</b>] CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL translation is performed on all files that
                     don't have a "well-known binary" extension.  The list
                     of known extensions can be found at the beginning of
                     <i>fs/fat/misc.c</i> (as of 2.0, the list is: exe, com, bin,
                     app, sys, drv, ovl, ovr, obj, lib, dll, pif, arc, zip,
                     lha, lzh, zoo, tar, z, arj, tz, taz, tzp, tpz, gz, tgz,
                     deb, gif, bmp, tif, gl, jpg, pcx, tfm, vf, gf, pk, pxl,
                     dvi).

              Programs that do computed lseeks won't like in-kernel text
              conversion.  Several people have had their data ruined by this
              translation.  Beware!

              For filesystems mounted in binary mode, a conversion tool
              (fromdos/todos) is available.  This option is obsolete.

       <b>cvf_format=</b><i>module</i>
              Forces the driver to use the CVF (Compressed Volume File)
              module cvf_<i>module</i> instead of auto-detection.  If the kernel
              supports kmod, the cvf_format=xxx option also controls on-
              demand CVF module loading.  This option is obsolete.

       <b>cvf_option=</b><i>option</i>
              Option passed to the CVF module.  This option is obsolete.

       <b>debug  </b>Turn on the <i>debug</i> flag.  A version string and a list of
              filesystem parameters will be printed (these data are also
              printed if the parameters appear to be inconsistent).

       <b>discard</b>
              If set, causes discard/TRIM commands to be issued to the block
              device when blocks are freed.  This is useful for SSD devices
              and sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs.

       <b>dos1xfloppy</b>
              If set, use a fallback default BIOS Parameter Block
              configuration, determined by backing device size. These static
              parameters match defaults assumed by DOS 1.x for 160 kiB, 180
              kiB, 320 kiB, and 360 kiB floppies and floppy images.

       <b>errors=</b>{<b>panic</b>|<b>continue</b>|<b>remount-ro</b>}
              Specify FAT behavior on critical errors: panic, continue
              without doing anything, or remount the partition in read-only
              mode (default behavior).

       <b>fat=</b>{<b>12</b>|<b>16</b>|<b>32</b>}
              Specify a 12, 16 or 32 bit fat.  This overrides the automatic
              FAT type detection routine.  Use with caution!

       <b>iocharset=</b><i>value</i>
              Character set to use for converting between 8 bit characters
              and 16 bit Unicode characters.  The default is iso8859-1.
              Long filenames are stored on disk in Unicode format.

       <b>nfs=</b>{<b>stale_rw</b>|<b>nostale_ro</b>}
              Enable this only if you want to export the FAT filesystem over
              NFS.

              <b>stale_rw</b>: This option maintains an index (cache) of directory
              inodes which is used by the nfs-related code to improve look-
              ups. Full file operations (read/write) over NFS are supported
              but with cache eviction at NFS server, this could result in
              spurious <b>ESTALE </b>errors.

              <b>nostale_ro</b>: This option bases the inode number and filehandle
              on the on-disk location of a file in the FAT directory entry.
              This ensures that <b>ESTALE </b>will not be returned after a file is
              evicted from the inode cache. However, it means that
              operations such as rename, create and unlink could cause
              filehandles that previously pointed at one file to point at a
              different file, potentially causing data corruption. For this
              reason, this option also mounts the filesystem readonly.

              To maintain backward compatibility, '-o nfs' is also accepted,
              defaulting to <b>stale_rw</b>.

       <b>tz=UTC </b>This option disables the conversion of timestamps between
              local time (as used by Windows on FAT) and UTC (which Linux
              uses internally).  This is particularly useful when mounting
              devices (like digital cameras) that are set to UTC in order to
              avoid the pitfalls of local time.

       <b>time_offset=</b><i>minutes</i>
              Set offset for conversion of timestamps from local time used
              by FAT to UTC.  I.e., <i>minutes</i> minutes will be subtracted from
              each timestamp to convert it to UTC used internally by Linux.
              This is useful when the time zone set in the kernel via
              <a href="../man2/settimeofday.2.html">settimeofday(2)</a> is not the time zone used by the filesystem.
              Note that this option still does not provide correct time
              stamps in all cases in presence of DST - time stamps in a
              different DST setting will be off by one hour.

       <b>quiet  </b>Turn on the <i>quiet</i> flag.  Attempts to chown or chmod files do
              not return errors, although they fail.  Use with caution!

       <b>rodir  </b>FAT has the ATTR_RO (read-only) attribute. On Windows, the
              ATTR_RO of the directory will just be ignored, and is used
              only by applications as a flag (e.g. it's set for the
              customized folder).

              If you want to use ATTR_RO as read-only flag even for the
              directory, set this option.

       <b>showexec</b>
              If set, the execute permission bits of the file will be
              allowed only if the extension part of the name is .EXE, .COM,
              or .BAT.  Not set by default.

       <b>sys_immutable</b>
              If set, ATTR_SYS attribute on FAT is handled as IMMUTABLE flag
              on Linux.  Not set by default.

       <b>flush  </b>If set, the filesystem will try to flush to disk more early
              than normal.  Not set by default.

       <b>usefree</b>
              Use the "free clusters" value stored on FSINFO.  It'll be used
              to determine number of free clusters without scanning disk.
              But it's not used by default, because recent Windows don't
              update it correctly in some case.  If you are sure the "free
              clusters" on FSINFO is correct, by this option you can avoid
              scanning disk.

       <b>dots</b>, <b>nodots</b>, <b>dotsOK=</b>[<b>yes</b>|<b>no</b>]
              Various misguided attempts to force Unix or DOS conventions
              onto a FAT filesystem.

<h2><a id="Mount_options for iso9660" href="#Mount_options for iso9660"></a>Mount options for iso9660  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       ISO 9660 is a standard describing a filesystem structure to be used
       on CD-ROMs. (This filesystem type is also seen on some DVDs.  See
       also the <i>udf</i> filesystem.)

       Normal <i>iso9660</i> filenames appear in a 8.3 format (i.e., DOS-like
       restrictions on filename length), and in addition all characters are
       in upper case.  Also there is no field for file ownership,
       protection, number of links, provision for block/character devices,
       etc.

       Rock Ridge is an extension to iso9660 that provides all of these
       UNIX-like features.  Basically there are extensions to each directory
       record that supply all of the additional information, and when Rock
       Ridge is in use, the filesystem is indistinguishable from a normal
       UNIX filesystem (except that it is read-only, of course).

       <b>norock </b>Disable the use of Rock Ridge extensions, even if available.
              Cf. <b>map</b>.

       <b>nojoliet</b>
              Disable the use of Microsoft Joliet extensions, even if
              available.  Cf. <b>map</b>.

       <b>check=</b>{<b>r</b>[<b>elaxed</b>]|<b>s</b>[<b>trict</b>]}
              With <b>check=relaxed</b>, a filename is first converted to lower
              case before doing the lookup.  This is probably only
              meaningful together with <b>norock </b>and <b>map=normal</b>.  (Default:
              <b>check=strict</b>.)

       <b>uid=</b><i>value</i> and <b>gid=</b><i>value</i>
              Give all files in the filesystem the indicated user or group
              id, possibly overriding the information found in the Rock
              Ridge extensions.  (Default: <b>uid=0,gid=0</b>.)

       <b>map=</b>{<b>n</b>[<b>ormal</b>]|<b>o</b>[<b>ff</b>]|<b>a</b>[<b>corn</b>]}
              For non-Rock Ridge volumes, normal name translation maps upper
              to lower case ASCII, drops a trailing `;1', and converts `;'
              to `.'.  With <b>map=off </b>no name translation is done.  See
              <b>norock</b>.  (Default: <b>map=normal</b>.)  <b>map=acorn </b>is like <b>map=normal</b>
              but also apply Acorn extensions if present.

       <b>mode=</b><i>value</i>
              For non-Rock Ridge volumes, give all files the indicated mode.
              (Default: read and execute permission for everybody.)  Since
              Linux 2.1.37 one no longer needs to specify the mode in
              decimal. (Octal is indicated by a leading 0.)

       <b>unhide </b>Also show hidden and associated files.  (If the ordinary files
              and the associated or hidden files have the same filenames,
              this may make the ordinary files inaccessible.)

       <b>block=</b>{<b>512</b>|<b>1024</b>|<b>2048</b>}
              Set the block size to the indicated value.  (Default:
              <b>block=1024</b>.)

       <b>conv=</b>{<b>a</b>[<b>uto</b>]|<b>b</b>[<b>inary</b>]|<b>m</b>[<b>text</b>]|<b>t</b>[<b>ext</b>]}
              (Default: <b>conv=binary</b>.)  Since Linux 1.3.54 this option has no
              effect anymore.  (And non-binary settings used to be very
              dangerous, possibly leading to silent data corruption.)

       <b>cruft  </b>If the high byte of the file length contains other garbage,
              set this mount option to ignore the high order bits of the
              file length.  This implies that a file cannot be larger than
              16 MB.

       <b>session=</b><i>x</i>
              Select number of session on multisession CD. (Since 2.3.4.)

       <b>sbsector=</b><i>xxx</i>
              Session begins from sector xxx. (Since 2.3.4.)

       The following options are the same as for vfat and specifying them
       only makes sense when using discs encoded using Microsoft's Joliet
       extensions.

       <b>iocharset=</b><i>value</i>
              Character set to use for converting 16 bit Unicode characters
              on CD to 8 bit characters.  The default is iso8859-1.

       <b>utf8   </b>Convert 16 bit Unicode characters on CD to UTF-8.

       <b>iocharset=</b><i>name</i>
              Character set to use for converting from Unicode to ASCII.
              The default is to do no conversion.  Use <b>iocharset=utf8 </b>for
              UTF8 translations.  This requires CONFIG_NLS_UTF8 to be set in
              the kernel <i>.config</i> file.

       <b>resize=</b><i>value</i>
              Resize the volume to <i>value</i> blocks.  JFS only supports growing
              a volume, not shrinking it.  This option is only valid during
              a remount, when the volume is mounted read-write.  The <b>resize</b>
              keyword with no value will grow the volume to the full size of
              the partition.

       <b>nointegrity</b>
              Do not write to the journal.  The primary use of this option
              is to allow for higher performance when restoring a volume
              from backup media.  The integrity of the volume is not
              guaranteed if the system abnormally ends.

       <b>integrity</b>
              Default.  Commit metadata changes to the journal.  Use this
              option to remount a volume where the <b>nointegrity </b>option was
              previously specified in order to restore normal behavior.

       <b>errors=</b>{<b>continue</b>|<b>remount-ro</b>|<b>panic</b>}
              Define the behavior when an error is encountered.  (Either
              ignore errors and just mark the filesystem erroneous and
              continue, or remount the filesystem read-only, or panic and
              halt the system.)

       <b>noquota</b>|<b>quota</b>|<b>usrquota</b>|<b>grpquota</b>
              These options are accepted but ignored.

       Reiserfs is a journaling filesystem.

       <b>conv   </b>Instructs version 3.6 reiserfs software to mount a version 3.5
              filesystem, using the 3.6 format for newly created objects.
              This filesystem will no longer be compatible with reiserfs 3.5
              tools.

       <b>hash=</b>{<b>rupasov</b>|<b>tea</b>|<b>r5</b>|<b>detect</b>}
              Choose which hash function reiserfs will use to find files
              within directories.

              <b>rupasov</b>
                     A hash invented by Yury Yu. Rupasov.  It is fast and
                     preserves locality, mapping lexicographically close
                     file names to close hash values.  This option should
                     not be used, as it causes a high probability of hash
                     collisions.

              <b>tea    </b>A Davis-Meyer function implemented by Jeremy
                     Fitzhardinge.  It uses hash permuting bits in the name.
                     It gets high randomness and, therefore, low probability
                     of hash collisions at some CPU cost.  This may be used
                     if EHASHCOLLISION errors are experienced with the r5
                     hash.

              <b>r5     </b>A modified version of the rupasov hash.  It is used by
                     default and is the best choice unless the filesystem
                     has huge directories and unusual file-name patterns.

              <b>detect </b>Instructs <i>mount</i> to detect which hash function is in use
                     by examining the filesystem being mounted, and to write
                     this information into the reiserfs superblock.  This is
                     only useful on the first mount of an old format
                     filesystem.

       <b>hashed_relocation</b>
              Tunes the block allocator.  This may provide performance
              improvements in some situations.

       <b>no_unhashed_relocation</b>
              Tunes the block allocator.  This may provide performance
              improvements in some situations.

       <b>noborder</b>
              Disable the border allocator algorithm invented by Yury Yu.
              Rupasov.  This may provide performance improvements in some
              situations.

       <b>nolog  </b>Disable journaling.  This will provide slight performance
              improvements in some situations at the cost of losing
              reiserfs's fast recovery from crashes.  Even with this option
              turned on, reiserfs still performs all journaling operations,
              save for actual writes into its journaling area.
              Implementation of <i>nolog</i> is a work in progress.

       <b>notail </b>By default, reiserfs stores small files and `file tails'
              directly into its tree.  This confuses some utilities such as
              <b>LILO</b>(8).  This option is used to disable packing of files into
              the tree.

       <b>replayonly</b>
              Replay the transactions which are in the journal, but do not
              actually mount the filesystem.  Mainly used by <i>reiserfsck</i>.

       <b>resize=</b><i>number</i>
              A remount option which permits online expansion of reiserfs
              partitions.  Instructs reiserfs to assume that the device has
              <i>number</i> blocks.  This option is designed for use with devices
              which are under logical volume management (LVM).  There is a
              special <i>resizer</i> utility which can be obtained from
              <i>ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfsprogs</i>.

       <b>user_xattr</b>
              Enable Extended User Attributes.  See the <a href="../man5/attr.5.html">attr(5)</a> manual page.

       <b>acl    </b>Enable POSIX Access Control Lists.  See the <a href="../man5/acl.5.html">acl(5)</a> manual
              page.

       <b>barrier=none </b>/ <b>barrier=flush</b>
              This disables / enables the use of write barriers in the
              journaling code.  barrier=none disables, barrier=flush enables
              (default).  This also requires an IO stack which can support
              barriers, and if reiserfs gets an error on a barrier write, it
              will disable barriers again with a warning.  Write barriers
              enforce proper on-disk ordering of journal commits, making
              volatile disk write caches safe to use, at some performance
              penalty.  If your disks are battery-backed in one way or
              another, disabling barriers may safely improve performance.

       <b>size=</b><i>nbytes</i>
              Override default maximum size of the filesystem.  The size is
              given in bytes, and rounded up to entire pages.  The default
              is half of the memory.  The size parameter also accepts a
              suffix % to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of
              your physical RAM: the default, when neither size nor
              nr_blocks is specified, is size=50%

       <b>nr_blocks=</b>
              The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_CACHE_SIZE

       <b>nr_inodes=</b>
              The maximum number of inodes for this instance.  The default
              is half of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a
              machine with highmem) the number of lowmem RAM pages,
              whichever is the lower.

       The tmpfs mount options for sizing (<b>size</b>, <b>nr_blocks</b>, and <b>nr_inodes</b>)
       accept a suffix <b>k</b>, <b>m </b>or <b>g </b>for Ki, Mi, Gi (binary kilo (kibi), binary
       mega (mebi) and binary giga (gibi)) and can be changed on remount.

       <b>mode=  </b>Set initial permissions of the root directory.

       <b>uid=   </b>The user id.

       <b>gid=   </b>The group id.

       <b>mpol=[default|prefer:Node|bind:NodeList|interleave|interleave:NodeList]</b>
              Set the NUMA memory allocation policy for all files in that
              instance (if the kernel CONFIG_NUMA is enabled) â€“ which can be
              adjusted on the fly via 'mount -o remount ...'

              <b>default</b>
                     prefers to allocate memory from the local node

              <b>prefer:Node</b>
                     prefers to allocate memory from the given Node

              <b>bind:NodeList</b>
                     allocates memory only from nodes in NodeList

              <b>interleave</b>
                     prefers to allocate from each node in turn

              <b>interleave:NodeList</b>
                     allocates from each node of NodeList in turn.

              The NodeList format is a comma-separated list of decimal
              numbers and ranges, a range being two "hyphen-minus"-separated
              decimal numbers, the smallest and largest node numbers in the
              range.  For example, mpol=bind:0â€“3,5,7,9â€“15

              Note that trying to mount a tmpfs with an mpol option will
              fail if the running kernel does not support NUMA; and will
              fail if its nodelist specifies a node which is not online.  If
              your system relies on that tmpfs being mounted, but from time
              to time runs a kernel built without NUMA capability (perhaps a
              safe recovery kernel), or with fewer nodes online, then it is
              advisable to omit the mpol option from automatic mount
              options.  It can be added later, when the tmpfs is already
              mounted on MountPoint, by 'mount -o
              remount,mpol=Policy:NodeList MountPoint'.

       UBIFS is a flash file system which works on top of UBI volumes.  Note

                     UBI device number <b>0</b>, volume with name <b>NAME</b>
       Alternative <b>!  </b>separator may be used instead of <b>:</b>.

       The following mount options are available:

       <b>bulk_read</b>
              Enable bulk-read.  VFS read-ahead is disabled because it slows
              down the file system.  Bulk-Read is an internal optimization.
              Some flashes may read faster if the data are read at one go,
              rather than at several read requests.  For example, OneNAND
              can do "read-while-load" if it reads more than one NAND page.

       <b>no_bulk_read</b>
              Do not bulk-read.  This is the default.

       <b>chk_data_crc</b>
              Check data CRC-32 checksums.  This is the default.

       <b>no_chk_data_crc</b>.
              Do not check data CRC-32 checksums.  With this option, the
              filesystem does not check CRC-32 checksum for data, but it
              does check it for the internal indexing information.  This
              option only affects reading, not writing.  CRC-32 is always
              calculated when writing the data.

       <b>compr=</b>{<b>none</b>|<b>lzo</b>|<b>zlib</b>}
              Select the default compressor which is used when new files are
              written.  It is still possible to read compressed files if
              mounted with the <b>none </b>option.

       <b>ufstype=</b><i>value</i>
              UFS is a filesystem widely used in different operating
              systems.  The problem are differences among implementations.
              Features of some implementations are undocumented, so its hard
              to recognize the type of ufs automatically.  That's why the
              user must specify the type of ufs by mount option.  Possible
              values are:

              <b>old    </b>Old format of ufs, this is the default, read only.
                     (Don't forget to give the -r option.)

              <b>44bsd  </b>For filesystems created by a BSD-like system (NetBSD,
                     FreeBSD, OpenBSD).

              <b>ufs2   </b>Used in FreeBSD 5.x supported as read-write.

              <b>5xbsd  </b>Synonym for ufs2.

              <b>sun    </b>For filesystems created by SunOS or Solaris on Sparc.

              <b>sunx86 </b>For filesystems created by Solaris on x86.

              <b>hp     </b>For filesystems created by HP-UX, read-only.

              <b>nextstep</b>
                     For filesystems created by NeXTStep (on NeXT station)
                     (currently read only).

              <b>nextstep-cd</b>
                     For NextStep CDROMs (block_size == 2048), read-only.

              <b>openstep</b>
                     For filesystems created by OpenStep (currently read
                     only).  The same filesystem type is also used by Mac OS
                     X.

       <b>onerror=</b><i>value</i>
              Set behavior on error:

              <b>panic  </b>If an error is encountered, cause a kernel panic.

              [<b>lock</b>|<b>umount</b>|<b>repair</b>]
                     These mount options don't do anything at present; when
                     an error is encountered only a console message is
                     printed.

       First of all, the mount options for <i>fat</i> are recognized.  The <b>dotsOK</b>
       option is explicitly killed by <i>vfat</i>.  Furthermore, there are

       <b>uni_xlate</b>
              Translate unhandled Unicode characters to special escaped
              sequences.  This lets you backup and restore filenames that
              are created with any Unicode characters.  Without this option,
              a '?' is used when no translation is possible.  The escape
              character is ':' because it is otherwise invalid on the vfat
              filesystem.  The escape sequence that gets used, where u is
              the Unicode character, is: ':', (u &amp; 0x3f), ((u&gt;&gt;6) &amp; 0x3f),
              (u&gt;&gt;12).

       <b>posix  </b>Allow two files with names that only differ in case.  This
              option is obsolete.

       <b>nonumtail</b>
              First try to make a short name without sequence number, before
              trying <i>name~num.ext</i>.

       <b>utf8   </b>UTF8 is the filesystem safe 8-bit encoding of Unicode that is
              used by the console.  It can be enabled for the filesystem
              with this option or disabled with utf8=0, utf8=no or
              utf8=false.  If `uni_xlate' gets set, UTF8 gets disabled.

       <b>shortname=</b><i>mode</i>
              Defines the behavior for creation and display of filenames
              which fit into 8.3 characters.  If a long name for a file
              exists, it will always be the preferred one for display.
              There are four <i>mode</i>s:

              <b>lower  </b>Force the short name to lower case upon display; store
                     a long name when the short name is not all upper case.

              <b>win95  </b>Force the short name to upper case upon display; store
                     a long name when the short name is not all upper case.

              <b>winnt  </b>Display the short name as is; store a long name when
                     the short name is not all lower case or all upper case.

              <b>mixed  </b>Display the short name as is; store a long name when
                     the short name is not all upper case.  This mode is the
                     default since Linux 2.6.32.

<h2><a id="THE_LOOP DEVICE" href="#THE_LOOP DEVICE"></a>THE LOOP DEVICE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       One further possible type is a mount via the loop device.  For
       example, the command

              <b>mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -t vfat -o loop=/dev/loop3</b>

       will set up the loop device <i>/dev/loop3</i> to correspond to the file
       <i>/tmp/disk.img</i>, and then mount this device on <i>/mnt</i>.

       If no explicit loop device is mentioned (but just an option `<b>-o loop</b>'
       is given), then <b>mount </b>will try to find some unused loop device and
       use that, for example

              <b>mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -o loop</b>

       The mount command <b>automatically </b>creates a loop device from a regular
       file if a filesystem type is not specified or the filesystem is known
       for libblkid, for example:

              <b>mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt</b>

              <b>mount -t ext3 /tmp/disk.img /mnt</b>

       This type of mount knows about three options, namely <b>loop</b>, <b>offset </b>and
       <b>sizelimit</b>, that are really options to <a href="../man8/losetup.8.html">losetup(8)</a>.  (These options can
       be used in addition to those specific to the filesystem type.)

       Since Linux 2.6.25 auto-destruction of loop devices is supported,
       meaning that any loop device allocated by <b>mount </b>will be freed by
       <b>umount </b>independently of <i>/etc/mtab</i>.

       You can also free a loop device by hand, using <b>losetup -d </b>or <b>umount</b>
       <b>-d</b>.

       <b>mount </b>has the following return codes (the bits can be ORed):

       <b>0      </b>success

       <b>1      </b>incorrect invocation or permissions

       <b>2      </b>system error (out of memory, cannot fork, no more loop
              devices)

       <b>8      </b>user interrupt

       <b>16     </b>problems writing or locking /etc/mtab

       <b>32     </b>mount failure

       <b>64     </b>some mount succeeded

       The command <b>mount -a </b>returns 0 (all succeeded), 32 (all failed), or
       64 (some failed, some succeeded).

<h2><a id="EXTERNAL_HELPERS" href="#EXTERNAL_HELPERS"></a>EXTERNAL HELPERS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The syntax of external mount helpers is:

              <b>/sbin/mount.</b><i>suffix spec dir</i> [<b>-sfnv</b>] [<b>-o </b><i>options</i>] [<b>-t</b>
              <i>type</i><b>.</b><i>subtype</i>]

       where the <i>suffix</i> is the filesystem type and the <b>-sfnvo </b>options have
       the same meaning as the normal mount options.  The <b>-t </b>option is used
       for filesystems with subtypes support (for example <b>/sbin/mount.fuse</b>
       <b>-t fuse.sshfs</b>).

       The command <b>mount </b>does not pass the mount options <b>unbindable</b>,
       <b>runbindable</b>, <b>private</b>, <b>rprivate</b>, <b>slave</b>, <b>rslave</b>, <b>shared</b>, <b>rshared</b>, <b>auto</b>,
       <b>noauto</b>, <b>comment</b>, <b>x-*</b>, <b>loop</b>, <b>offset </b>and <b>sizelimit </b>to the
       mount.&lt;suffix&gt; helpers.  All other options are used in a comma-
       separated list as argument to the <b>-o </b>option.

<h2><a id="BUGS" href="#BUGS"></a>BUGS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       It is possible for a corrupted filesystem to cause a crash.

       Some Linux filesystems don't support <b>-o sync and -o dirsync </b>(the
       ext2, ext3, fat and vfat filesystems <i>do</i> support synchronous updates
       (a la BSD) when mounted with the <b>sync </b>option).

       The <b>-o remount </b>may not be able to change mount parameters (all
       <i>ext2fs</i>-specific parameters, except <b>sb</b>, are changeable with a remount,
       for example, but you can't change <b>gid </b>or <b>umask </b>for the <i>fatfs</i>).

       It is possible that files <i>/etc/mtab</i> and <i>/proc/mounts</i> don't match on
       systems with regular mtab file. The first file is based only on the
       mount command options, but the content of the second file also
       depends on the kernel and others settings (e.g. remote NFS server.
       In particular case the mount command may reports unreliable
       information about a NFS mount point and the /proc/mounts file usually
       contains more reliable information.) This is another reason to
       replace mtab file with symlink to the <i>/proc/mounts</i> file.

       Checking files on NFS filesystem referenced by file descriptors (i.e.
       the <b>fcntl </b>and <b>ioctl </b>families of functions) may lead to inconsistent
       result due to the lack of consistency check in kernel even if noac is
       used.

       The <b>loop </b>option with the <b>offset </b>or <b>sizelimit </b>options used may fail
       when using older kernels if the <b>mount </b>command can't confirm that the
       size of the block device has been configured as requested.  This
       situation can be worked around by using the <b>losetup </b>command manually
       before calling <b>mount </b>with the configured loop device.
